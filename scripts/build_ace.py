"""Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) per storm per day, North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific, from NOAA IBTrACS v04r01.

  build_ace.py                 download the two basin files and write the outputs below
  build_ace.py --local DIR     use ibtracs.NA.list.v04r01.csv and ibtracs.EP.list.v04r01.csv already in DIR

Outputs
  data/ace_daily.csv    date, basin (NA = North Atlantic, EP = Northeast Pacific, east of 180°), storm id, name, ace:
                        one row per storm per day on which it added ACE, from 1971 on.
  data/ace_meta.json    source files and the newest observation in each basin (the "data through" date).
  data/ace_check.txt    season totals compared with published values.

How ACE is counted (the NHC/CSU convention)
  For every 6-hourly fix (00, 06, 12, 18 UTC) at which the storm is a tropical or subtropical storm or a hurricane
  (USA_STATUS TS, SS, HU or HR) with maximum sustained wind of at least 34 kt, add wind² / 10,000 (wind in knots,
  USA_WIND, the 1-minute mean from NHC best track or, for the current season, NHC's operational data).
  Each fix counts on its own date and in the basin it was in at that moment (BASIN column), so a storm that crosses
  from the Atlantic into the Pacific, or across the date line, counts in each basin only for its time there.
  Interpolated points (3-hourly, or USA intensity filled in, IFLAG 'P' or 'I'), special landfall times and spur tracks
  are not counted. Rows are de-duplicated on storm id and time, because a storm appears in both basin files.
